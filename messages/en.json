The pneumatic separator is a welded housing divided into a series of chambers by partitions. Grain, along with the air used for its transport, enters the settling chamber of the pneumatic separator through the inlet pipe. Under its own weight, the grain opens the flap and falls in a thin layer into the pneumatic separating channel, where it is blown with air. ",

The air velocity and the intensity of the grain blowing are adjusted using a movable wall, which allows the cross-sectional area of the channel to be changed. The cleaned grain is discharged from the pneumatic separator through an airlock valve. The cleaned grain is removed from the pneumatic separator through a rotary valve. "
